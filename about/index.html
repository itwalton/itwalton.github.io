          My name is Ian Walton. I'm a full-stack software developer/consultant living in Dallas, Texas. I currently work as an SFCC consultant for Accenture, but the content and opinions on this blog are my own.

          I get excited about technology, traveling, nature, and coffee. I enjoy questioning popular processes, sometimes aggressively, and learning new ways to tackle old problems.

        <p>
          I read a lot; mostly textbooks, non-fiction, tech blogs. My favorite book right now is probably <a href="//www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" class="und">Clean Code by Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin</a>.
