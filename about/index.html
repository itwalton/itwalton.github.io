          When not writing software or hunting for cool domains, I enjoy reading, brewing beer and painting/playing Warhammer40K. I enjoy questioning popular processes,
          sometimes aggressively, and learning new ways to tackle old problems.

          I read a lot; mostly textbooks, non-fiction, tech blogs. My favorite book right now is probably <a
            href="//www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" class="und">Clean Code by
            Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin</a>.
